Comedown machine

Look, Tap Out is a good song. So is the All the Time - but after that, you really think you've heard enough of this album. "I get the gist," you know? THEN that little synth riff at the beginning of One Way Trigger kicks in and you're back up again. That song makes you pick your ass up and Dance, but in a kinda melancholy way, kind of a Charlie Brown type dance. Like you're dancing and Remembering. "You asked me to stay..." 

Then, bang, we're pulled out of that moment, like snapping out of a daydream, straight into the passenger seat of a convertible doing a $dollar down the Pacific Coast Highway. Goddamn right it's Welcome to Japan. This song is refined slick oily Cool, and it makes you feel cool. Hell, it _makes_ you cool all on its own. And when you hit that ending, it's like crashing out after a really good run, like sprinting and tripping on a rock. And that brief, glorious moment where you were on top of the world is over. And then - 

You open your eyes.

Here it is, masked behind this arpeggio somewhere between a violin and a synth, this heart-monitor rhythm that makes you feel like the song is scanning you somehow: the Comedown Machine. You can practically se the title card appearing before your eyes. After such a bombastic beginning to the album, we've finally reached our limit and crumbled under the pressure - but that was just the prologue. We've reached the true heart of the story. In the life of a rockstar, we've just jumped the shark. We're crashing out. We're down. 

But we don't stay there for long.
