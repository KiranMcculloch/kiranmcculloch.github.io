                    <h2 id="about-header">About</h2>
                    <p>Kiran McCulloch is, in brief, a man of elegant solutions. From the moment an idea pops into his head, his enthusiasm for the task at hand becomes unmatchable. He is governed by a desire to create. Similarly, his fervor for learning often leaves him with several Wikipedia tabs open or hours spent doing online trivia. McCulloch alone is a force to be reckoned with, but given the right tools and let into a room with similarly driven individuals, infinity's the limit.</p>

                    <h3 id="coding-header">Coding</h3>
                    <p>Having grown up as a self-described "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego">Lego</a> kid,"<sup>[1]</sup> McCulloch's fascination with coding
                        as a building-block-like tool has been noted from a very young age. Regarding programming as
                        the ultimate creative outlet, McCulloch is proficient in several programming languages such as
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>,

                        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>, having worked with them extensively throughout high
                        school and university alike, both in class and on personal time. University courses have
                        provided similar ventures into 
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>,

                        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">OCaml</a>, and several others. In addition, he remains very
                        familiar with

                    <h3 id="geography-header">Geography</h3>
                    <p>McCulloch's pet passion has always been geography, from a very basic level, such as memorizing
                        all the world capitals and flags, to a very advanced one, like creating his own <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">LIDAR</a>-based
                        watershed delineation algorithm. Having further expanded his knowledge with a broad range of studies in
                        the subject at university, he continues to try find a way back to use it in any possible project.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="design-header">Design</h3>
                    <p>Creativity is at the heart of everything McCulloch does. His earliest several jobs were all
                        editing-focused, and since then he has ventured into web design, photography, vector graphics,
                        animation, film, photobashing, printing, and more.<sup>[2]</sup> Possessing a significant amount
                        of work experience, McCulloch is well-known as a designer in his social circles, often acting as a go-to
                        source for social media posts and advertisements but also picking up more consistent
                        extracurricular work at times. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">Photoshop</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro">Premiere</a> are the most used tools to this end, but <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AfterEffects">After Effects</a>,

                    <h2 id="history-header">History</h2>
                    <h3 id="early-life-header">Early Life</h3>
                    <p>Kiran McCulloch was born in Philadelphia, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> at the turn of the millennium. Several
                        years later, McCulloch, along with his parents and sisters, would move to a nearby suburb, where he
                        would reside for more than a decade before his eventual move to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>. McCulloch has, somewhat
                        hyperbolically, described Philadelphia as "the greatest city on the planet"<sup>[3]</sup> and
                        remains fiercely proud of his city to this day.</p>
                    <h3 id="schooling-header">Schooling</h3>
                    <p>After attending a small private school in the suburbs for almost eight years, McCulloch made the
                        move in 2012 to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germantown_Friends_School">Germantown Friends School</a> in Philadelphia's <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germantown,_Philadelphia">Germantown</a> neighborhood. It was here that
                        he took his first coding classes and competed in his first hackathon, later citing these
                        experiences as heavy inspiration for his future work.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
                    <p>
                        The looming end of high school presented a difficult decision as to where to attend university;
                        with multiple offers of equal academic caliber on the table, the choice would come down to personal
                        preference.<sup>[5]</sup> In the spring of 2018, McCulloch visited Montreal for the first time
                        in his life, and, seeing its quality, made the decision to attend <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGill_University">McGill University</a> that fall.</p>
                    <p>
                        Over the next four years, McCulloch built valuable skills and greatly expanded upon his
                        knowledge base, taking courses in Algorithm Design, Web Development, Robotics, and Artificial
                        Intelligence, among many others. McCulloch also pursued his passion for geography,
                        taking courses in such topics as hydrology, climatology, human geography, and meteorology.
                        Despite the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">breakout of a worldwide pandemic</a> in his second year, McCulloch completed his studies in
                        2022, graduating with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in geography.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="work-experience-header">Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>The precise start date of McCulloch's career remains a hotly debated topic among
                        historians,<sup>[6]</sup> but most sources place it in 2013, when, while at sleepaway camp, the
                        head of the Video Department trusted McCulloch, a child, with the keys to the computer room, citing
                        his work ethic and technological zeal, but more likely than not also taking advantage of the
                        free labor. Since then, McCulloch has always been comfortable working in a collaborative environment,
                        and teamwork remains a staple of his projects.</p>
                    <p>
                        The proper start came in 2017 when a month-long internship at a film studio provided McCulloch
                        with his first foray into a professional environment. Despite returning to school shortly after, he
                        gained valuable experience working in a fast-paced environment. In 2019, After his first year at
                        university, McCulloch found a job at the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Natural_Sciences_of_Drexel_University">Academy of Natural Sciences</a> in downtown Philadelphia,
                        working as an environmental researcher, combining his passions of coding and geography into one.
                        Here, he was truly a young professional, developing a codebase on the then-unused <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth#Google_Earth_Engine">Google Earth Engine</a>. 
                        In 2020, immediately after the pandemic hit, McCulloch worked for a while as IT support
                        for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications">Verizon</a>, spending the summer dealing with hardware problems as opposed to the software
                        he was more used to.</p>
                    <p>
                        Despite being busy with classes, McCulloch also found time to take on scores of freelance design
                        projects for friends, family, and paying clients alike. It was here that he began to combine his
                        talents once more, and found a taste for Web Development, being a combination of design and
                        coding, much like his job at the Academy years prior had been a fusion of coding and geography.
                        Naturally, then, his work in these years tended towards the arts, working remotely for a design firm in
                        Boston and then heading the Graphics Division in a student-led project at McGill.
